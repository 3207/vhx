# vhx
A Screen Pixel Ruler in JavaFX
This is my first experience with github so forgive me if I screw something up.
The program is free to use and there's video posted on YouTube demoing it's
features.

Feb 15, 2107 -- Updated vhx to fix a small bug at startup that wasn't being checked.  
Changed my commenting style to something lighter looking. I actually use this program to
help me with my other coding projects.
